This project implements an AI-powered image search engine similar to Google Images. It uses OpenAI's CLIP model to generate embeddings for a dataset of images (e.g., STL-10) and FAISS for fast similarity search. Users can upload an image via Streamlit and see the top 4 similar images in a clean 2x2 grid.
